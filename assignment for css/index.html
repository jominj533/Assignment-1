						<h3>About</h3>
							<p>A zoo is a location where animals are kept in confinement and displayed for public viewing. 
								The term "zoo" is an abbreviation for "zoological park." 
								Zoos house a diverse range of creatures native to all regions of the globe.
							</p>
							<p>People began to want to study animals for scientific purposes around this period.
								Animal habits and morphology were of interest to scientists.
								To accomplish this, scientists and zookeepers had to maintain animals in environments that were similar to or identical to the animals' native habitats.
							</p>
							<p>In 1793, the first contemporary zoo debuted in Paris, France. 
								Leaders of the French Revolution took over the menageries of French aristocrats, including the monarch and queen, and moved them to the Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. 
								The zoo is still a bustling and famous attraction in downtown Paris.

							<h3>Types of Zoos</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Urban</li>
								<li>Suburban</li>
							</ol>
						<p>Urban zoos, located in large cities, still resemble the smaller zoos that were popular 200 years ago. Often, these zoos sit in the middle of cities, making expansion difficult. 
						There is little room for urban zoos to grow, and many of the zoo’s buildings are historic landmarks that cannot be destroyed or redesigned.</p>
